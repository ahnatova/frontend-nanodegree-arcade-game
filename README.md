# Classic Arcade Game (Frogger)

## How to start the game:

1. Open the index.html file
2. Download the project using the "Clone or download" (it is the green button on the right side). You can download the files as .ZIP or use the Git and command git clone <URL>, read more on how to use Git here: https://git-scm.com/
3. Use the arrow keys to move the character, that is located in the middle of the bottom row

## How to win the game:
Your goal is to reach the water (top row), when you do so, the game ends and a message appears on your screen saying that you have won. :)

However, on your way there, you have to avoid those nasty bugs. If you run into a bug, the game resets your character to the initial position.
